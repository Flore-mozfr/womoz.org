====== **PAST TODO section - Up to 2010** (obsolete, only for the record): ======
We now list our TODO items on our [[http://womoz.etherpad.mozilla.org/|Etherpad Meeting Notes]]

====== Ideas for Add Ons ======

  * An extension that computes all kind for values for Food&Nutrition, what you ate that day

  * Addon giving the TV program on our preferred channels and reminds us to record them (or watch them before they are no more available on Internet)


====== Ideas for Interview Questions ======

  * Video interviews:
    * Latinamerican girls in Open source: http://chicasopensourcelatam.noc-root.net/doku.php
Interview questions more specifically here: http://chicasopensourcelatam.noc-root.net/doku.php?id=preguntas_de_entrevista

====== Idea of any kind ======
//Feel free to edit and add your suggestions to promote women in Mozilla and open source//

-> **Short-term**

  * In order to know where we stand, get statistics about Women in Mozilla. How many employees, how many volunteers? In which areas. Where do we stand?
    * **Employees**: 16.75% See blog post here:  http://www.womoz.org/blog/number-of-women-in-mozilla/
\\
-> **Long(er)-term:**

  * Competition for designing a women tshirt on the free software theme?\\
  * Contact & work with Open Source, ICTs, gender groups, [[http://womoz.org/wiki/doku.php?id=todo_list#education|education]], social inclusion, NGOs & such
  * A directory of every woman indulging in Open Source software would be nice
  * Push Women on code on the foreground:
I recently discovered [[https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/13681| this excellent and original extension]] designed by Margaret Leibovic. She is [[http://margaret.mit.edu/about/ |a Mozilla intern!]] 

Her extension is reviewed on [[http://lifehacker.com/5340079/aboutme-displays-your-browsing-trends |lifehacker]], a site founded by another geek woman, Gina Trapani.


My suggestion: contact her, publish an interview with her, and why not ask her how it could be possible she drives a sort of "Hey Girlz Build Your Own Extension" workshop one of these days.

  * A series of interviews to promote prominent or more ordinary women on Open source 
something like "woman on open source of the month" ...speaking about what she is involved in, how she got to fumble in open source, what were her probs if any, what are her projects

Project: Gather new and current data about women in IT and women in Open Source: either on French National level (accurate) or internation level (probably less accurate). Analyze them and present the results in a website using html5 technologies (svg, canvas..)

How to gather this information:\\
- National: INSEE, professional organisations...\\
- Europe: http://epp.eurostat.ec.europa.eu/portal/page/portal/statistics/search_database\\
- International: maybe looking at IMF or related ( http://stats.uis.unesco.org/unesco/TableViewer/document.aspx?ReportId=136&IF_Language=eng&BR_Topic=0 )\\
- In order to analyze analyze http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gini_coefficient\\

Student project can be found on Github: https://github.com/francois-le-francais/Womoz-projet-DLL/wiki/_pages
