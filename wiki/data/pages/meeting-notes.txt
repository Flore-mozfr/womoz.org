====== Meeting Notes: 16/02/2012 ======
 

   * Delphine will check location, timing, schools/communities to involve -- target group-size.\\  Sponsorship?

   * CDM will share Event "footprint" presentation.

   * Budget:  It's roughly 15,000 euros spread fairly equally across:
- Labcoats (3000-4,000 euros depending on the number of girls);\\
- Location overhead (security, rental, lunch/catering, insurance, etc.); and \\
- Project Mgt/Travel/Promotion/Materials stuff (e.g. g4g overhead)\\
But these are only indications for you to keep in mind... \\
- We should probably also consider a nominal reservation/admin fee (15-20 Euros?) for each attendee, depending on the target communities/schools.  First, it helps to decrease no-shows, and frankly, if we don't get sponsorship for the full budget above, we'll at least be able to cover our costs, hopefully.    (Depending on what we decide here, the presentation would need to be modified.)

  * Follow-up Blogpost mid-March: Cheryl will do that

====== Meeting Notes: 16/03/2012 ======

  * **SPONSORSHIP**

Potential sponsors need to see a proposal for paris event. Send cheryl's presentation updated w/ date and location. 
Once we have content and material, then we can give them something concrete to evaluate.

  * **LOCATION**

- Space needed:\\
There will be 120 girls max\\
7 girls / workshop\\
18 workshops: so we need 18 workshop leaders\\
\\
If we have a fun lab, that takes out 1/4th girls of that\\

- Coding gouter are willing to help out with finding location if necessary

- a school would be perfect. Let's first look for schools more than another location.
TARGET A SCHOOL FIRST !!!\\
Ask them to pay for the event if it's the private school, then ask for sponsorship from their organizations, the ones they know.\\

- Rally women teachers (science maths, etc) to get their girls to go.\\
- Try private schools (légion d'honneur, lycée international, etc)\\
- And less public schools as well. \\
- Can be in suburbs of Paris \\
- Tell all of them to pass on word about event.\\

  *  **TIMING**

- Summer vacation starts on 5th of July for all. \\
So let's do it end of june (one of the last 2 saturdays in June)\\
\\
  * **WORKSHOP LEADERS**
- need 18 people\\
- ask everyone we can, I should find at least 15 because Cheryl probably has 3 already\\

  * **CLEARLY DISTRIBUTE TASKS OUT:**\\
- workshop and workshop leaders on the moment\\
- registration - managing the attendees on the moment (probably doing an admin fee)\\
- funlab and sponsorship - the sponsors have their stuff there too, so pp can play with that. There are gadgets and toys, from sponsors and others as well. A lot of gaming related stuff, game tests, quizz things, \\
- Role model speech can be from someone from sponsor, someone inspiring
(beginning of the day and end of the day).\\
- Need a speach for the end, to wrap-up the day: I'll do that\\
- onsite logistics\\
- promotion and marketing\\

[Note: When a project is helping out with money = sponsor. If a project is helping out with workshop = partner. They will both have their logos on website, etc.]

**My tasks:**\\
- I oversee funlabs \\
- sponsorship \\
- workshop \\
- workshop leaders,\\ 
- eventbrite: different workshops and see if I let the girls choose all, or only choose 1 or 2 workshop from eventbrite. They will only be able do to 3 during the day and there are 18 workshops.\\


**Need other people to be in charge of these tasks:**\\
- onsite logistics\\
- promotions and marketing- getting 3 schools on board can help a lot\\
- registration\\
- eventbrite will probably be helped by vencianne - she does the cool printing and collating the agendas\\


  * **WHAT'S NEXT?**

- We need to define pp in charge for different tasks\\

- next TODO action items:\\
	- Cheryl's follow-up blog post\\
	- setup an clear agenda for the event: a planning schedule. I'll put it online on the womoz wiki so we can work on it all together\\
	- people in charge of different and specific tasks should be defined\\
	- know where the event will take place: make reservation\\
	- know about sponsorship for Mozilla (me)\\
	- start "sponsorship quest"\\
\\
