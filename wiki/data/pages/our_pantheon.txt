====== Grace Hopper ======
{{:pantheon:grace_hopper.jpg?200 }}\\
\\
**Born - Died:**\\
December 9, 1906, New York, U.S.A. - 1st January 1992\\

**Occupation:**\\
Computer Scientist & Rear Amiral

**Education:**\\
  * Master's degree in mathematics and physics\\
  * Ph.D. in mathematics

**Biography:**\\
She knew that the only way to introduce computers in non-scientific as well as in commercial sectors was to refine the programming language to become a language understandable by non-mathematicians. Her belief that the programs could be written in English aroused the hilarity of her colleagues. At that time, a wide commercial was not the concern of IBM, and general belief was that only scientists were able to use computers. By writing in 1952 the first compiler, Hopper has allowed the spread as the widespread use of these languages, and thus opened the door of programming to all, rather than a small handful of mathematicians.

====== Ada Lovelace ======

{{:pantheon:ada_lovelace.jpg?200 }}\\
\\
**Born - Died:** \\ 
December 10, 1815, London, England\\
November 27, 1852, London, England

**Occupation:** \\
Countess of Lovelace \\

**Education:** \\
  * Privately home-schooled in Mathematics and Sciences

**Biography:** \\ 
She is mainly known for having written a description of Charles Babbage's early mechanical general-purpose computer, the analytical engine. She is today appreciated as the "first programmer" since she was writing programs — that is, manipulating symbols according to rules — for a machine that Babbage had not yet built. She also foresaw the capability of computers to go beyond mere calculating or number-crunching while others, including Babbage himself, focused only on these capabilities. \\
(...) In 1953, over one hundred years after her death, Lovelace's notes on Babbage's Analytical Engine were republished. The engine has now been recognized as an early model for a computer and Lovelace's notes as a description of a computer and software. \\
The computer language Ada, created by the U.S. Defense Department, was named after Lovelace. The reference manual for the language was approved on 10 December 1980, and the Department of Defense Military Standard for the language, "MIL-STD-1815", was given the number of the year of her birth ([[http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ada_Lovelace|Wikipedia extract]])
