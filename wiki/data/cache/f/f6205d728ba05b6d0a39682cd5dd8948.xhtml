It might seem a bit tricky at first sight to participate in an open source project. Not that the community is especially closed, but when you&#039;re new it can easily become unclear how and where to start.<br/>

<br/>

<em>Will I be accepted?</em><br/>

<em>Am I competent enough to help people who are already quite techies?</em><br/>

<em>But I don&#039;t code, I&#039;m not very good in all that computer stuff…</em><br/>

<em>I have good programming knowledge but I don&#039;t know where to start to contribute efficiently</em><br/>

<br/>

This page is for helping visitors and contributors-to-be to understand how we usually contribute to open source and Mozilla, and describes the projects we work on.

<p>

The open source “underground world” suffers from many prejudices. Time to break some of them.

<br/>

If many contributors wear glasses, we don&#039;t (always!) exclusively spend our days in front of computers.<br/>

And not all open source community members are coders. In fact, contribution is needed in many different fields:
</p>
<ul>
<li class="level1"><div class="li"> <strong>Localization</strong>: this is the specific term used for translation. Programs, websites, community manifestos,… You can contribute efficiently to the progress of a project by helping out thanks to your translation skills</div>

<div class="level2">

<p>

<strong>FALSE!</strong><br/>

While open source is unquestionably a male-dominated field, this does not mean that it is a harsh or combative place.<br/>

<br/>

The Open Source World is an environment easy to enter: in fact, you simply offer your assistance, by registering on a mailing list, forum or wiki, joining an <acronym title="Internet Relay Chat">IRC</acronym> chat and… TADAM! You&#039;ve become a contributor.<br/>

<br/>

You might also think that the demand for results, as well as competition, are strong among contributors.<br/>

On the contrary, the community - whether it is subject to the constraints of project management or quality of products - is not a place of fighting or competition. The aim is to work TOGETHER.<br/>

<br/>

For example, some contributors work on improving a source code version after version, and they do this together as a team. <strong>The community is not competitive but contributory</strong>.<br/>

<br/>

After all, we are what we are thanks to the sum of our knowledge and skills.

<h2><a name="you_must_be_stephen_hawking_to_contribute_to_open_source" id="you_must_be_stephen_hawking_to_contribute_to_open_source">You must be Stephen Hawking to contribute to open source</a></h2>
<div class="level2">

<p>
WHAT? YOU DON&#039;T KNOW WHO HAWKING IS?! WHAT A SHAME!!<br/>

<br/>

In fact, it&#039;s <strong>not</strong> a shame not to know everything when you enter a <acronym title="Free/Libre and Open Source Software">FLOSS</acronym> project. Remember this <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ubuntu_(philosophy)" class="urlextern" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ubuntu_(philosophy)"  rel="nofollow">Ubuntu</a> sentence: <em>“I am what I am because of what we are all”</em>.<br/>

<br/>

The aim is to gather profiles as diverse as possible around the same open source project, to improve the product, do localization, evangelism, events,… An open source project is a multi-task project that can&#039;t be done by only one person or one kind of person: we need graphical competences for advertisement and presentations, organizational skills for events&#039; management, languages competences for localization,…<br/>

<br/>

What matters the most to open source teams is curiosity, passion and learning will. <em class="u">Really</em>. <br/>

</p>

<p>
And in case you wonder, Stephen Hawking is a searcher in cosmology, as well as a mathematics teacher at the University of Cambridge: <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stephen_Hawking" class="urlextern" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stephen_Hawking"  rel="nofollow">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stephen_Hawking</a>

<div class="level2">

<p>

You might have already experienced something similar to this: you enter a room full of men who suddenly stop talking and watch you intensely. You almost feel like an intruder, and maybe even a prey. You might overhear snickers and comments on your expertise, on your physical appearance,…<br/>

<br/>

Although this situation is not to be considered as typical and common (many women also report they have never noticed anything of the sort in male-dominated communities), this is an (exaggerated) example that has already been reported. When you are part of a minority, you inevitably stand out in the crowd. And the reason for this is simply because you are <strong>different</strong>. Some people feel uncomfortable when faced with anything different from them: they don&#039;t know what to expect so they doubt of your capacities.<br/>

<br/>

But wouldn&#039;t you stare and ask yourself questions if a purple elephant entered your room? Of course you would, because you are not used to seeing such a thing.
Not saying that women are purple elephants (!), this is just to illustrate how they inevitably stand out in a male-dominated crowd.<br/>

<br/>

The situation described above, quite caricaturist of course and not to be considered as a generality, demonstrates a simple fact: there are very few women working in computer science. And we need more women for mentalities and awkward behaviors to evolve and change.
