====== Redesigning the WoMoz Website ======

===== Tracking bug ===== 

We have set up a tracking bug for the WoMoz website. You can find it here on Bugzilla: https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=529868

===== Staging Website =====

To follow the changes concerning the WoMoz website, please see here: http://www.womoz.org/stage/

===== Community Notes =====

//Please use and edit this section as you wish to add your suggestions and ideas.//

  * Use Mozilla Communities logo
  * Change the boxes with the 3 default pics representing the wiki, website and ml -> find cool logos and use a carousel 
  * Integrate the videos from the WoMoz video website -> maybe put inside the carousel as well
  * Stay coherent with the rest of the websites -> so with the designs of the blog, wiki and video sites
     * This may be pretty hard, because wiki and blogs have a lot different design(as in colors, images, content placing)
  * Agree on the content that will appear on the page, so the design fits well
  * Maybe add a womoz facebook logo on the page, linking to the womoz facebook page
